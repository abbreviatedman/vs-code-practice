# flex-profile

### Your mission, should you choose to accept it.

* Fork this repo. Make _sure_ you're cloning the **forked** version, NOT the original!
* Unless otherwise noted, do not edit the HTML. You should be working in the CSS file! CSS is magic!
* You will be adding, committing, and pushing with EVERY SINGLE BULLET POINT BELOW. I want to see commit messages of "Adds holy grail layout", "rotates layout", "rotates layout back", "fixes user avatar src paths", and so on. I'll be checking this!
* Open the page in a browser. (VS Live Server is a great solution for this.) Boy is this thing ugly, huh? Give the project a Holy Grail layout with flexbox. The divs, with ids and classes, have already been made for you.
* Give the links in the nav section some spacing in between. With flexbox, mind you!
* Now rotate that layout by -90 degrees, i.e., counter-clockwise, i.e., to the left. The header should end up on the left and the navbar at the bottom. You should be able to do this simply by changing one line of css and adding another!
* Now change it back.
* The `src` attributes on the user avatars are broken. Fix them. Use the HTML for this step (and this step alone!).
* Put the user profile cards in a row next to each other.
* You'll notice that they just keep going to the right. That's a pretty gross layout right there. How do we fix this? Think "wrap".
* Put the bios and profile-link images to the right to the user avatars.

Well done! It looks pretty good now!

 I mean... PRETTY good, anyway.

### Stretch Goals - Let's make everything look a little better.

* Add some spacing between the user profiles and the nav/sidebar areas on either side. Because I set specific width percents, you can't do this by editing the main section!
* Center the header. There are easier ways, but use flex-box!
* The reason I had you use flex-box? Now I want you to do the same for the footer, but put it to the right.
